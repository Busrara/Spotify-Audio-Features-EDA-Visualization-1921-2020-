# Spotify-Audio-Features-EDA-Visualization-1921-2020-

This project explores over 160,000 songs from Spotify, spanning nearly 100 years of music (1921–2020). Using audio feature data like *danceability*, *energy*, *valence*, and more, I analyze and visualize how music has evolved.

## 📊 What’s Inside?

This Python script performs:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Time-series trends in audio features
- Distribution of features like energy, popularity and valence
- Most common artists & song durations
- Correlation heatmap between audio features

Visualizations are generated using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 💡 Key Visual Insights

- How loudness has increased over the decades  
- The rise and fall of danceability through time  
- Which years had the highest *valence* (musical positivity)  
- Feature relationships (e.g., energy vs. danceability)

You can find the visualization in this repository.
